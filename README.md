# Mini JavaScript Projects

This repository contains a number of react apps. Each project is simple and readable.

## Introduction

Welcome to the React Projects repository! These projects are for beginners who want to become experts in React because these are basic projects that build the base and logic of a coder. I hope these projects will help you think like a programmer.

## Project Structure

Each app project is contained in its own directory and includes the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the app.
- `src/main.jsx`: The root component of the app.
- `src/App.jsx`: The entry file that renders the React app.
- `src/components/`: The folder containing reusable React components.
- `src/index.css`: The file containing tailwind utilies.
- `src/App.css`: The file containing external css styling.
- `tailwind.config.js`: The Tailwind configuration file, where customizations like colors, spacing, and themes are set.
- `postcss.config.js`: The PostCSS configuration file, used for
processing Tailwindâ€™s styles.
- `package.json`: The file containing project metadata and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: The file that locks dependencies for consistent installs.
- `.gitignore`: The file specifying which files and directories to ignore in Git.
- `README.md` : The file containing documentation for the project.
